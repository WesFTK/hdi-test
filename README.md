### Widget placement rules

| Location | What goes here |
|----------|----------------|
| `lib/widgets/` | Truly reusable widgets — no page-specific logic, usable across multiple features (`SummaryCard`, `TransactionTile`, `SectionHeader`) |
| `pages/<feature>/ui/widgets/` | Widgets used only by that feature's page (e.g., `SpendChart` is dashboard-only, filter chips are history-only) |
| `pages/<feature>/ui/pages/` | The page entry point — composes widgets and connects the BLoC |

**State management:** Each page owns a scoped BLoC. `AuthBloc` is created and disposed by `_AppViewState`, exposed via `BlocProvider.value`. `ThemeCubit` lives at the app root and drives `MaterialApp` theme. All BLoC states use a single-class freezed pattern with a `StatusState` enum (`idle`, `loading`, `loaded`, `error`). All BLoCs route events through a single `on<Event>(_onEvent)` handler using `event.when(...)` dispatch.

**Theme:** `AppColors` defines typed color tokens (`AppColorScheme`) for light and dark modes. `AppTypography` maps Poppins + Inter to the full Material `TextTheme`. `AppThemeExtension` (a `ThemeExtension<T>`) injects shimmer colors into the theme tree. No `isDark` boolean checks exist in widget code — all color decisions use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` tokens.

**Responsive layout:** `ScreenTypeLayout.builder` switches between mobile and tablet layouts at 600dp. Two concerns are handled separately:

- **Layout switching** — `responsive_builder` at 600dp breakpoint. Mobile and tablet have completely separate widget trees.
- **Size scaling** — `flutter_screenutil` with `Size(390, 844)` as the phone Figma baseline. `.w/.h/.sp/.r` in mobile layout code scale relative to this canvas.

Tablet layout code uses **plain logical pixels** (no `.w/.h` suffix) since no tablet Figma exists — tablet layout is "best effort" proportional design using `Expanded` with `flex` ratios and fixed dp values.

**Font size scaling (`fontSizeResolver`):**

```dart
fontSizeResolver: (fontSize, instance) {
  final scale = min(
    instance.screenWidth / _designSize.width,   // width ratio
    instance.screenHeight / _designSize.height, // height ratio
  ).clamp(0.85, 1.3);
  return fontSize * scale;
},
```

- `min(scaleWidth, scaleHeight)` — takes the smaller of the two ratios. On a tablet (1280×800), width ratio = 3.28x but height ratio = 0.95x, so `min()` picks 0.95x. Prevents font blowup on wide screens and landscape mode.
- `.clamp(0.85, 1.3)` — hard floor and ceiling. Prevents fonts from going below 85% of design size (very small screens / landscape) or above 130% (edge cases).
- Without this override, ScreenUtil's default `.sp` uses width-only scaling — 3.28x on tablet = unreadably large text.

**System font scale (`MediaQuery.withClampedTextScaling`):**

```dart
MediaQuery.withClampedTextScaling(
  minScaleFactor: 0.8,
  maxScaleFactor: 1.3,
  child: MaterialApp.router(...),
)
```

When a user sets a large font in device Settings → Display → Font Size, Flutter's `TextScaler` multiplies all text sizes. Fixed-height containers then overflow. Clamping at 1.3x respects accessibility preferences while keeping layouts intact. `minScaleFactor: 0.8` prevents overly tiny text on devices set to the smallest font size.

**`View.of(context)` rebuild behavior:** Called inside `BlocBuilder`'s builder, so the widget registers a dependency on `FlutterView`. It rebuilds when physical screen size or device pixel ratio changes — concretely: device rotation or desktop window resize. On a typical phone/tablet this is ~2 events per app lifetime (startup + one rotation). Not a performance concern — it's the correct signal for recalculating `isTablet`. The alternative (calculating once in `initState`) would silently show the wrong layout after rotation.

**If a tablet Figma exists:** replace the single `designSize` with adaptive detection using `View.of(context)` before `ScreenUtilInit` is constructed (safe because it reads the platform view, not ScreenUtil itself). Remove `fontSizeResolver` — two correct baselines mean no override is needed.

```dart
builder: (context, themeMode) {
  final view = View.of(context);
  final logicalWidth = view.physicalSize.width / view.devicePixelRatio;
  final isTablet = logicalWidth >= 600;
  return ScreenUtilInit(
    designSize: isTablet ? const Size(1024, 768) : const Size(390, 844),
    minTextAdapt: true,
    builder: (context, child) => MaterialApp.router(...),
  );
},
```

Phone (390×844 Figma) → scale = 1.0x on a 390px device, pixel-perfect.
Tablet (1024×768 Figma) → scale = 1.0x on a 1024px device, pixel-perfect.
Each form factor matches its own design baseline with no manual overrides.

**Navigation:** `go_router` uses a `GoRouterRefreshStream` on `AuthBloc.stream` so redirects re-evaluate on every auth state change.

**Session persistence:** `AuthBloc` self-dispatches `AppStarted` on construction, which reads an `isLoggedIn` flag from Hive synchronously. No async wait before the first route renders.

**Error handling:** Repositories return `AsyncResult<T>` (from `result_dart`) instead of throwing. BLoCs fold the result into success or error states.

## Features

- **Login** — Member ID or valid email + password, form validation, FlushBar error toast, cooldown to prevent spam
- **Dashboard** — Member info card, 3 summary cards (paid this month, last transaction, membership status), 6-month spend bar chart, recent transactions list, pull-to-refresh
- **Purchase History** — Reactive multi-filter (month, status, category) — all filters compose, results update immediately
- **Personalization** — Dark / Light / System theme selection, persisted across restarts
- **Logout** — Clears session, returns to login
- **Shimmer loading** — Skeleton UI on every data screen
- **Empty state** — Shown when filters yield no results
- **Error state** — Retry button on fetch failure
- **Tablet layout** — Two-column dashboard, sidebar filter panel in history, split branding/form auth screen

---

## Assumptions & Tradeoffs

- All data is in-memory mock data. Repositories add a 500 ms artificial delay to make shimmer visible.
- Session uses a boolean flag in Hive (sufficient for mock auth; a real app would store a signed token).
- `result_dart` is used with `AsyncResult<T>` = `Future<ResultDart<T, Exception>>`. The `fold` pattern keeps BLoC handlers free of try/catch.
- Each feature page lives under `pages/<feature>/ui/pages/` and `ui/widgets/`. No barrel exports — router imports the canonical paths directly.

## Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Test coverage

| File | What is tested |
|------|----------------|
| `test/repositories/auth_repository_test.dart` | Login with member ID, email, wrong password, empty password; session persist/clear via Hive |
| `test/blocs/auth_bloc_test.dart` | Constructor auto-dispatches `AppStarted` → authenticated/unauthenticated; `LoginSubmitted` → loading+authenticated or loading+error; `LogoutRequested` → unauthenticated |
| `test/blocs/history_bloc_test.dart` | `LoadHistory` emits full list; `FilterChanged` by status, category, month, combined filters, and clearing filters |

Tests use `bloc_test` for BLoC state assertions and `mocktail` for repository mocking.
